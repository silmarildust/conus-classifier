# conus-classifier
The master folder for my geometric morphometric-based machine learning classifier of Conus shells. I am working on this project independently.

This does not include the data files (images, landmarks, results), since the project is still ongoing.

The pipeline for geometric morphometrics is:
1. Landmark images using ImageJ, ImgLab, or a similar tool
2. If multiple specimen per image, crop images to bounding boxes using 'image_preprocessing.py'
3.
